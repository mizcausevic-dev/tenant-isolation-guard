# Why We Built This

**tenant-isolation-guard** grew out of repeated work around identity governance, where the hardest problems were rarely about raw data collection. The real challenge was turning scattered evidence into something humans could govern quickly.

The recurring pressure in this space showed up around identity sprawl, tenant-boundary mistakes, and access-review workflows that are technically complete but poorly explained. In practice, that meant teams could collect logs, metrics, workflow state, documents, or events and still not have a good answer to the hardest questions: what is drifting, what matters first, who owns the next move, and what evidence supports that move? Once a system reaches that point, the problem is no longer only technical. It becomes operational.

That is why **tenant-isolation-guard** was built the way it was. The repo is a deliberate attempt to model a real operating layer for IAM, platform security, compliance, and internal platform teams. It is not just trying to present data attractively or prove that a stack can be wired together. It is trying to show what happens when evidence, prioritization, and next-best action are treated as first-class product concerns.

The surrounding tooling was not useless. IGA suites, ticket approvals, and access review campaigns each handled a slice of the work. But they still left out a fast, legible control layer for access reasoning at the moment decisions are made. That gap kept turning ordinary review work into detective work.

That shaped the design philosophy:

- **operator-first** so the riskiest or most time-sensitive signal is surfaced early
- **decision-legible** so the logic behind a recommendation can be understood by humans under pressure
- **review-friendly** so the repo supports discussion, governance, and iteration instead of hiding the reasoning
- **CI-native** so checks and narratives can live close to the build and change process

This repo also avoids trying to be a vague platform for everything. Its value comes from being opinionated about a real problem: C# ASP.NET Core service for tenant-boundary policy evaluation, cross-tenant risk scoring, and isolation-focused platform response planning.

What comes next is practical. The roadmap is about richer entitlement evidence, clearer review context, and stronger ties into adjacent platform controls. The point of the repo is to turn that messy middle layer into something teams can actually work with.
